title: How to contribute a best practice

# {{page.title}}
This page is hosted on Github pages, which means you can contribute by heading over to the [Repo]({{site.github.repository_url}}), cloning it, and adding a pull request. Your name will then be mentioned on the frontpage, so it's a great opportunity if you want to get your name out there. But even if you don't want to contribute a best practice, please feel free to join the discussions or request a best practice for a certain topic. Besides that, you can always help making something more understandable, adding screenshots, requesting someone to add their best practice to the repo, or share the repo with your peers. 

This page can use Markdown for formatting. Here is a quick primer, but we also have the contribution [template]({{ site.github.url }}/new page template).

## Markdown

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
