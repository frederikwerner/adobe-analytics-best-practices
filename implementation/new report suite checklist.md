title: Checklist for creating new Report Suites
---
# {{page.title}}
When we create new Report Suites in Adobe Analytics, we should remind ourselves to check a couple of things to make sure we don't forget anything. The list is slightly different depending on if we copy an existing suite or start from zero.

For new Report Suites:
* Set up Evars, Props, and Events according to your Solution Design
* For web pages, set Internal URL filter to include all website domains
* Set calendar to meet your requirements (esp. First day of Week)

For copied Report Suites:
* Check if Evars, Props, and Events apply to both the new and old Report Suites
* Check if Internal URL filter is still correct
