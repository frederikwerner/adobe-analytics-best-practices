# {{page.title}}
When we create new Report Suites in Adobe Analytics, we should remind ourselves to check a couple of things to make sure we don't forget anything. This list should also be checked if you copy existing Report Suites.
* Set up Evars, Props, and Events according to your Solution Design or check when copying
* For web pages, set Internal URL filter to include all website domains
* Set calendar to meet your requirements (esp. First day of Week) and timezone
* Create Processing or change Processing Rules
* Create or check Marketing Channel Plugin Settings
* Add Report Suites to Advertising Analytics (AMO)
