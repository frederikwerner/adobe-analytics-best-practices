# {{page.title}}
The builtin list of Social Networks in Adobe Analytics is quite extensive already. But besides the already existing networks, it makes sense to also add the shortened variants for sites like facebook or twitter. From our experience, you should at least add those URLs:
* t.co (Twitter)
* fb.me (Facebook)
