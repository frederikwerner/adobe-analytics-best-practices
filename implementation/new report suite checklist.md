# {{page.title}}
When we create new Report Suites in Adobe Analytics, we should remind ourselves to check a couple of things to make sure we don't forget anything. This list should also be checked if you copy existing Report Suites.

* <input type="checkbox"> Set up Evars, Props, and Events according to your Solution Design or check when copying
* <input type="checkbox"> For web pages, set Internal URL filter to include all website domains
* <input type="checkbox"> Set calendar to meet your requirements (esp. First day of Week) and timezone
* <input type="checkbox"> Set or check Timestamp settings (especially when copying a Report Suite that has been created in Mobile Services)
* <input type="checkbox"> Create or change necessary Processing Rules
* <input type="checkbox"> Create or check Marketing Channel Plugin Settings
